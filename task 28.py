#Task 28
#Run the code below:
#if 2 + 2 != 4: 
    #print("2 + 2 is 4") 


if 2 + 2 != 4: 
    print("2 + 2 is 4") 

# the output will be nothing because the conditional statement is false, it will print nothing because print("2 + 2 is 4") is insidde the conditional statement. so as the conditional statement is false it will print nothing
