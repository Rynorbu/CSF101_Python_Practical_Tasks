#Define another variable called number2 and give it a value of 1
#What is the type of the variable number1 and number2?
#Compare if both the values inside the variables are equal using the == operator
#Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
#Display the result variable as an output using the print() function

number1 = 1
number2 = 1
print(type(number1), type(number2))
result = number1 == number2
