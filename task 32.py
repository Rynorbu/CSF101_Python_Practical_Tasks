##Task 32
#Define a variable called age and get it’s value from user input()
#Remember: the input() function returns a string, you need to convert it to an int
#Check if the age is above 18.
#If the age is above 22 (inclusive), display the output as: “I dont care”
#Or if the age is 18, display the output as “You pass”
#If the age is below 17, display the output as “you cannot touch beer”

age = int(input("Your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    if age >= 22:
        print("I dont care")
    elif age == 18:
        print("You pass")
else:
        print("you cannot touch beer")
