#Task 22
#Define a variable called number1 and give it a value of “1”
#Define another variable called number2 and give it a value of 1
#What is the type of the variable number1 and number2
#Compare if both the values inside the variables are equal using the == operator
#Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
#Display the result variable as an output using the print() function

number1 = "1" #str type
number2 = 1 #int type
print(type(number1), type(number2))

result = number1 == number2
print(result)

# the output will be false because the value of number1 and number2 is noe same or equal since value type of variable number1 is string whereas the value type of variable number2 is integer.
