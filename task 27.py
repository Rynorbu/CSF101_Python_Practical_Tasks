#Task 27
#Run the code below:
#if 2 + 2 == 4: 
    #print("2 + 2 is 4") 

if 2 + 2 == 4: 
    print("2 + 2 is 4") 

# this was printed because the conditional statement was true which will give an output 2 + 2 is 4. it will print 2 + 2 is 4 because print("2 + 2 is 4") is inside the conditional statement. so as the conditional statement is true it will print 2 + 2 is 4
