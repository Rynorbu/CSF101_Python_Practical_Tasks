#Task 29
#Define a variable called name and assign it a value of “dorji”
#Define a variable called friend and assign it a value of “Dorji”
#Compare if the two values of the variables name and friend are the same or not

name = "dorji"
friend = "Dorji"

if name == friend:
    print("they are same")
else:
    print("they are not same")

# they are not same due to the difference in the value of the two variable.
