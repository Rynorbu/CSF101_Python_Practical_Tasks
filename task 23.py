#Task 23
#Define a variable called number1 and give it a value of 1.0
#Define another variable called number2 and give it a value of 1
#What is the type of the variable number1 and number2
#Compare if both the values inside the variables are equal using the == operator
#Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
#Display the result variable as an output using the print() function

number1 = 1.0 #float type
number2 = 1 #int type
print(type(number1), type(number2))

result = number1 == number2
print(result)
